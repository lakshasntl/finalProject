# finalProject

The students at UMD will serve as our primary users and audience for the app we design as part of our final project. This project's goal is to develop a student-run platform that focuses on disseminating real-time alerts and information about occurrences and activities in the College Park neighborhood. By gathering feedback from onlookers in College Park, we hope to keep the neighborhood aware of its surroundings and safe. Our platform will only be focused on the UMD Campus and will highlight our dedication to protecting students' security, distinguishing us from other app rivals.

Two techniques are used in the project design to read the UMD Alerts Page and store the alerts in a list that is divided into the following three sections: title, date, and description. There are six major sections that make up the code:


1. Creating the messages: This section involves parsing the HTML pages and extracting relevant information from each alert, such as the title, date, and description.

2. Creating the notification: Here, a notification object is created for each new alert, which will contain the date and time.

3. Adding titles to the notifications: This section adds the title to the current notification object.

4. Classifying the notifications as three different types of alerts: The notifications are classified into three types: emergency, advisory, and safety notices. This classification helps determine the appropriate actions to take for each type of alert.

5. Creating an icon based on the type of alert: An icon is generated for each notification based on its classification. The icon represents the nature or severity of the alert.

6. Adding a sound to the notification based on the type of alert: A sound is added to each notification based on its classification. The sound serves as an additional indicator or alert signal.

Our team holds problem-solving meetings when issues arise during the development process. We hold Zoom discussions to pinpoint the precise difficulties someone is experiencing before coming up with solutions. We turn to our TA for advice if we hit a snag and are unable to come up with a workable answer. This method of problem-solving is demonstrated in the Classify course. When our team ran into problems, we discussed potential solutions and asked the TA for assistance, which ultimately resulted in the problems with that class being resolved.
