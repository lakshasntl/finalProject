# finalProject

Our project intends to create a mobile application with University of Maryland (UMD) students as its primary users and target market. This software aims to develop a student-run platform that concentrates on disseminating real-time notifications and information about occurrences and activities within the College Park neighborhood. Our app will aggressively solicit feedback from onlookers in College Park to keep the community aware and vigilant about their surroundings to protect their safety.


Our platform will only be focused on the UMD Campus, in contrast to other app rivals, proving our dedication to doing everything in our power to keep students safe. We distinguish ourselves in terms of providing pertinent and focused information since we recognize the significance of especially catering to the requirements and concerns of UMD students.

In order to organize the alerts into a list that is subsequently divided into title, date, and description sections, the app's design uses two major techniques that read through the UMD Alerts Page. Users can simply access and interpret the information presented thanks to this organised method.

There are six important sections in the code implementation:

1. Developing the messages The title, date, and description of each alert are among the crucial details that must be extracted from the UMD Alerts Page in this part. We ensure that our users receive accurate and up-to-date information about occurrences and events in the College Park community by rapidly collecting this data.

2. Making the notice: A notification object is generated for each new alert, with the pertinent date and time information. This function enables prompt alert transmission to app users.

3. Adding titles to the notifications: A title is given to each notification object that briefly describes the alert's nature. As a result, consumers may prioritize their responses and understand information more quickly.

4. The notifications are divided into three categories of alerts: Three unique categories—emergency, advisory, and safety notices—are used to group the alerts. Our app can help users better grasp the seriousness and urgency of each message by categorizing the notifications.

5. Icon generation based on alert classification: Based on the notification's classification, an icon is dynamically generated for each notice. The sort of alert and its associated ramifications are further communicated through this visual depiction.

6. Adding a sound to the notice in accordance with the alert category: Depending on how it is classified, each notification has a particular sound attributed to it. This auditory cue improves the app's capacity to grab the user's attention and guarantee timely action in response to important warnings.


Our app strives to improve communication within the UMD community by effectively implementing these elements, giving students the tools they need to stay informed, vigilant, and safe on campus.

Overall, our project combines state-of-the-art technology, a user-centric strategy, and effective code implementation to produce a powerful and user-friendly software that caters to the particular requirements of UMD students.
